					"Q1_TITLE": "What is Enecuum?",
					"Q1_ANSW_P1": "Enecuum is a blockchain mobile network for decentralized applications. It was created with a purpose to bring the blockchain and cryptocurrencies to the real mainstream, involving a crowd with regular mobile and desktop devices into the blockchain network. Enecuum allows each smartphone owner to be a part of our global network.",
					"Q2_TITLE": "How does it work?",
					"Q2_ANSW_P1": "In Enecuum, the consensus is achieved through interaction between the following three mining algorithms: Proof-of-Work (\"PoW\"), Proof-of-Activity (\"PoA\"), and Proof-of-Stake (\"PoS\"). This combination makes it possible to achieve a high degree of network decentralization. Currently, we have deployed the PoA algorithm in our mobile app, and PoW and PoS are available on PC for public testing."

					"Q4_TITLE": "What devices can I use to mine?",
					"Q4_ANSW_P1": "You can mine on any mobile device that runs Android (phones, tablets). Though Enecuum primarily aims at smartphones, our community has also managed to mine on IoT devices, TV boxes, and smartwatches!",
					"Q5_TITLE": "Can I mine on multiple devices?",
					"Q5_ANSW_P1": "Yes, but you need to create a separate account for every device.",
					"Q6_TITLE": "Can I mine on an emulated phone?",

					"Q1_ANSW_P1_2": "less than 5% faster",
					"Q1_ANSW_P1_3": "compared to normal device use.",
					"Q2_TITLE": "What about Internet use?",
					"Q2_ANSW_P1": "We recommend connecting to Wi-Fi when mining, but generally, the traffic usage is less than that of a messenger or a browser."

	"RESEARCH_PAPERS_A1_ABSTRACT": "The blockchain technology is currently penetrating different sides of modern ICT community. Most of the devices involved in blockchain-related processes are specially designed targeting only the mining aspect. At the same time, the use of wearable and mobile devices may also become a part of blockchain operation, especially during the charging time. The paper considers the possibility of using a large number of constrained devices supporting the operation of the blockchain. The utilization of such devices is expected to improve the efficiency of the system and also to attract a more substantial number of users. Authors propose a novel consensus algorithm based on a combination of Proof-of-Work (PoW), Proof-of-Activity (PoA), and Proof-of-Stake (PoS). The paper first overviews the existing strategies and further describes the developed cryptographic primitives used to build a blockchain involving mobile devices. A brief numerical evaluation of the designed system is also provided in the paper.",
